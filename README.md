krgn's systemd files

systemd files for public peruse. 
	
* i3lock service for locking the screen *before* going to sleep, in order to prevent showing parts of it before locking, right after wakeup
* xmodmap to re-institute the keyboard mappings so dearly needed after sleep (whoever thought that resetting them in the first place was in fact a good idea 
should burn in hell :))
